# See https://github.com/OCA/maintainer-quality-tools/blob/master/travis/clone_oca_dependencies
# The expected format for oca_dependencies.txt:
# * comment lines start with # and are ignored
# *  a dependency line contains:
#   - the name of the OCA project
#   - (optional) the URL to the git repository (defaulting to the OCA repository)
#   - (optional) the name of the branch to use (defaulting to ${VERSION}). It is
#     required if you want to select a commit SHA in the next parameter.
#   - (optional) the commit SHA1 to use. If you set this option you MUST specify
#     the branch
